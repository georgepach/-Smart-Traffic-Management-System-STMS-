# Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)

## About the Project
Urbanization and population growth have led to a dramatic increase in vehicle volume, causing severe traffic congestion in major cities. This congestion not only disrupts mobility but also contributes to rising carbon emissions, negatively impacting air quality and the environment.

This project aims to develop a **Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)** powered by **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to monitor, analyze, and optimize traffic flow in real-time. By leveraging **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, the system will detect vehicles, dynamically adjust traffic signal timings, and prioritize emergency vehicles and pedestrians.

## Project Overview
The **Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)** integrates cutting-edge technologies such as:
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** for real-time vehicle detection and classification.
- **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** for optimizing traffic light durations.
- **Internet of Things (IoT) and smart sensors** (Inductive Loops, radar, and traffic cameras) for real-time data collection.
- **Kalman Filters** for vehicle movement prediction and smoother traffic transitions.
- **Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication** for improved traffic coordination.

The combination of these technologies enables the system to respond dynamically to unforeseen conditions such as accidents or bad weather, reducing congestion and improving road safety.

## Project Goals
- Develop an **AI-powered** traffic management system to monitor and control urban traffic in real-time.
- Integrate **IoT and smart sensors** to collect real-time traffic data for intelligent decision-making.
- Use **machine learning algorithms** to optimize traffic signal timing dynamically.
- Reduce **carbon emissions** by minimizing idle times and improving traffic flow efficiency.
- Enhance **emergency response** by prioritizing ambulances and other essential vehicles.
