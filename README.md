# Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)

## About Project
The rapid growth of urbanization has led to increased traffic congestion, impacting mobility, air quality, and road safety. This project aims to develop a **Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)** utilizing **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** to monitor, analyze, and optimize traffic flow in real time. By integrating IoT, smart sensors, and advanced AI algorithms, STMS will improve urban mobility and reduce carbon emissions.

## Overview
The STMS project leverages cutting-edge technologies like **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** to detect and classify vehicles, dynamically adjust traffic signals, and prioritize emergency vehicles. IoT-enabled sensors, including **Inductive Loops, radar, and traffic cameras**, will gather real-time data to ensure efficient traffic control. Additionally, **Kalman Filters** will predict vehicle movement for smooth traffic transitions.

Vehicle-to-Infrastructure (V2I) communication will further enhance traffic efficiency by integrating GPS and navigation app data. This holistic approach enables the system to adapt to unexpected events such as accidents and bad weather conditions.

## Project Goals
- Develop an AI-powered **Smart Traffic Management System (STMS)** to monitor and control traffic in real time.
- Integrate **IoT, smart sensors, and AI algorithms** to optimize traffic light durations dynamically.
- Enable the system to **respond to unexpected events** like accidents and severe weather conditions.
- Reduce **carbon emissions** by minimizing idle vehicle time and improving traffic flow.
